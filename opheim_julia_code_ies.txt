# Problem 1.c

# The intercept matches almost exactly with the mean for the x-variable (since y is symmetric around 0 the intercept for this
# equation should be very similar to the mean of the marginal distribution for x). Similarly, the y coefficient matches with the 
# covariance between x and y which also has an intuitive meaning; the covariance between the two variables is how they relate 
# with one another, so when the equation is only a function of x on y then the coefficient for y should express this relationship.
