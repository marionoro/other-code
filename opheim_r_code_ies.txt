# The first-stage regression tells us that nearc4 is significantly correlated with education, which is
# a necessary (although not sufficient) assumption for nearc4 to be used as an instrument for education.
# Looking at the reduced form regression (which has the format of (2) except educ is replaced with nearc4),
# we can see that nearc4 has a significant positive relationship with log of a worker's wage; if we combine this
# with an assumption that nearc4 influences wages only through its effect on education, then we would conclude that education
# increases wages.
